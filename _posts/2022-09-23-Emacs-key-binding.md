## Emacs Key-binding

After half years of using emacs, there are some key-bindings that been normally use for my daily work.

1. Find file **C-x C-f**
2. Org agenda view **M-x 'org-agenda'**
3. Magit status **M-x 'magit (magit-status)'**
4. Split vertical window **C-w-v**
5. Search word **/**
