Eclipse Che is an open-source Java based developer workspace server and cloud integrated development environment (IDE) which provides a remote development platform for multi-user purpose. 
The workspace server comes with a RESTful webservice and provides high flexibility. It also contains a SDK which can be used to create plug-ins for languages, frameworks or tools. 
The main difference between Eclipse Che and the standard Eclipse IDE is its ability to create Docker containers to execute applications.
