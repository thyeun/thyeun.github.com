## Emacs

[*Emacs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) or *EMACS (Editor MACroS)* is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, *GNU Emacs*, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of 2022.

## My Emacs Workspace

I call my emacs workspace as **pacman emacs** with the logo of pacman ghost, it are modify and customize in between [**gnu emacs**](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/), [**vanilla emacs**](https://github.com/lccambiaghi/vanilla-emacs), [**doom emacs**](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) and [**spacemacs**](https://www.spacemacs.org/).

Update : Remove previous emacs workspace that based on **init.el** to now written as an Org Mode document.
