## i3wm

*i3* is a tiling window manager designed for [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), inspired by [wmii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager#X-tile-anchor), and written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). It supports tiling, stacking, and tabbing layouts, which it handles dynamically. Configuration is achieved via plain text file and extending i3 is possible using its [Unix domain socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) based [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) interface from many programming languages.

Like [wmii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager#X-tile-anchor), i3 uses a control system very similar to [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). By default, window focus is controlled by the `'Mod1'` (Alt key/Win key) plus the right hand home row keys (`Mod1+J,K,L,;`), while window movement is controlled by the addition of the Shift key (`Mod1+Shift+J,K,L,;`).

## Rofi
